# **Bank Marketing Campaign â€“ Subscription Prediction**

## **Overview**
This project explores machine learning methods to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a banking product after being contacted in a marketing campaign. Given the low success rate of previous campaigns, the goal is to improve targeting by focusing on customers most likely to subscribe.  

## **Dataset**
- **Filename:** `bank-full.csv`  
- **Size:** ~41,000 records  
- **Features:** 20 customer-related attributes  
- **Target Variable:** `y` (Binary: "yes" = subscribed, "no" = not subscribed)  

## **Objective**
- Build a **proof-of-concept machine learning model** to predict if a customer will subscribe.
- Ensure **good performance for both classes** (subscribers and non-subscribers).
- Provide insights into which factors contribute to customer subscription.

## **Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and categorical data.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - Apply feature scaling and selection.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Compare classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Use cross-validation for unbiased performance estimation.

3. **Performance Metrics:**
   - **Accuracy & Precision-Recall:** Ensure high accuracy while handling class imbalance.
   - **ROC-AUC Score:** Evaluate model's ability to distinguish between classes.
   - **Confusion Matrix & F1-Score:** Analyze false positives/negatives.

4. **Final Model & Insights:**
   - Train the best-performing model.
   - Interpret key features influencing subscription decisions.
   - Provide recommendations for marketing strategies.
